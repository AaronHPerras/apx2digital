When automation and AI workflows get complicated, I step in.

I help automation agencies and growing businesses solve the integration, reliability, and edge-case problems that appear after the simple solutions stop working.

Low-code tools move fast.
But real business systems are messy.

That’s where I work.

What I Do

I specialize in solving problems that usually show up when:

• Integrations start failing silently
• Data stops syncing reliably between platforms
• Automation logic grows fragile or unpredictable
• AI workflows produce inconsistent or unsafe outputs
• Low-code builds hit technical limits
• Teams need custom logic layered into existing systems

I’m typically brought in when projects are already underway and complexity begins to surface.

Who I Work With

I work primarily with:

Automation & AI Agencies

When client projects need deeper technical reliability, custom integrations, or escalation support.

Small and Mid-Sized Businesses

When internal automation, CRM systems, or AI workflows need to move from “working sometimes” to “working consistently and safely.”

How I Fit Into Projects

I’m not usually the first builder on a project.

I’m the specialist teams call when:

• Edge cases appear
• Data integrity becomes critical
• Systems need to scale beyond low-code defaults
• Automation logic needs to be hardened for real-world usage

Think of me as back-of-house technical support for complex workflow systems.

Areas I Commonly Work In

• Workflow automation architecture
• CRM and system integrations
• AI-assisted workflow design
• Data synchronization and reliability
• Automation debugging and rescue projects
• Custom scripting and platform extensions
• Process hardening and failure-proofing

My Approach

Most automation failures aren’t tool problems — they’re reliability and assumption problems.

My work focuses on:

• Anticipating failure points
• Designing for messy real-world data
• Making workflows observable and recoverable
• Keeping systems maintainable as they grow

The goal isn’t just to make automation work.
The goal is to make it dependable.

Example Engagements

(This section you’ll fill with 2–4 short case summaries later — extremely valuable, but can come after launch.)

Example format:

Designed and stabilized a multi-platform CRM synchronization workflow that prevented silent data loss and enabled safe reprocessing of failed records.

Short, outcome-focused, no jargon overload.

Working Together

Most engagements fall into one of three models:

• Escalation support for agency projects
• Short-term integration or reliability projects
• Ongoing advisory and system maintenance

If your automation or AI workflows are becoming complex, fragile, or difficult to maintain, I can help.
