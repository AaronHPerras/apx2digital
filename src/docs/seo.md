# Shotover Cleaning & Restoration – Service Area Update Plan

## Action Items for Optimizing Service Areas (Local SEO)

### 1. Audit & Define Service Areas
- Review current service area listings on the website and Google Business Profile.
- Identify all primary and secondary cities, towns, and neighborhoods served.
- Document any new areas to be added or old ones to be removed.

### 2. Update Google Business Profile (GBP)
- Log in to GBP and ensure “Service Areas” are up-to-date and accurate.
- Remove any outdated locations and add new ones.
- Confirm the physical address is hidden if the business does not serve customers at a physical location.

### 3. Website Content Updates
- Update the website’s “Service Areas” or “Areas We Serve” page with a clear, accurate, and comprehensive list.
- Create or improve individual location landing pages for each primary service area (if feasible).
    - Include unique, location-specific content (local landmarks, testimonials, service details, etc.).
    - Use geo-targeted keywords (e.g., “Water Damage Restoration in [City]”).
- Add an interactive map highlighting the service area, if possible.

### 4. On-Page SEO Enhancements
- Ensure each location page has optimized meta titles, descriptions, and H1 headers with the relevant location name.
- Add schema markup for LocalBusiness and ServiceArea, specifying the covered locations.
- Cross-link service area pages for better crawlability and user experience.

### 5. Citations & Directory Listings
- Update NAP (Name, Address, Phone) and service area info on major local directories (Yelp, BBB, Angi, etc.) to match the website and GBP.
- Submit new citations for recently added locations, if necessary.

### 6. Reviews & Local Signals
- Encourage customers from different service areas to leave reviews mentioning their city/area.
- Showcase reviews by region or location on the website (if possible).

### 7. Ongoing Monitoring & Adjustments
- Track local rankings for each service area using Google Search Console and local rank tracking tools.
- Periodically review analytics to see which locations/pages are driving conversions.
- Adjust content and service area targeting based on performance and business needs.

## Notes
- Avoid creating “doorway” pages (thin, duplicate content just to target locations).
- Focus on providing real value and helpful information for each service area.
- Make sure all information is consistent across web, GBP, and citations.
