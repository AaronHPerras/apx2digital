### Overview

APx2 Digital offers flexible tech solutions management for growing businesses. My focus is on making your operations more efficient, automated, and scalable—using modern no-code platforms like **Airtable, Notion, Zapier, and more**. This proposal outlines a service plan designed to cover project-based builds, ongoing maintenance, and ad-hoc support, all with the agility your team needs.

### Service Offerings

#### 1. No-Code Tool Development & Automation
- **Design & build custom workflows, dashboards, and databases** in Airtable, Notion, or other platforms.
- **Integrate business apps** using Zapier (and similar tools): automate repetitive tasks, connect data sources, and streamline processes.
- **Documentation & training** for your team on new tools and systems.

#### 2. Tech Systems Support & Maintenance
- **Ongoing troubleshooting and optimization** for existing workflows.
- **Minor feature requests, tweaks, and updates** to keep solutions aligned with business needs.
- **Ad-hoc consulting:** Advice on best practices, platform selection, and tech strategy.

#### 3. Project & Ad-Hoc Engagements
- **Project-based builds:** Scoped out and delivered on timeline agreed with client.
- **Ad-hoc tasks:** For urgent needs, small changes, or one-off fixes—within the weekly time ceiling.

#### 4. Edge Case Handling & Flexibility
- **Flexible time allocation:** Up to **15 hours/week**, split between project work and support as needed.
- **Priority handling:** Urgent issues can be escalated with reasonable notice.
- **Scope management:** If a request might exceed the weekly ceiling, I’ll flag it early and propose options (phased delivery, alternate solutions, or overtime at agreed rates).
- **No hard enforcement:** The goal is to collaborate and keep things running smoothly, not to rigidly track every minute—open communication is key.

#### 5. Delivery & Workflow

- **Communication:** Progress updates will be provided regularly, with opportunities for feedback and adjustments along the way.
- **Flexibility:** Ad-hoc or urgent requests can be accommodated within the agreed weekly time ceiling, or scheduled as needed.
