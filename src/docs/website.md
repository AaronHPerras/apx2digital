Thank you for considering APx2 Digital as your partner for building a modern, high-performing website that truly reflects your brand’s values and marketing goals. We specialize in delivering clean, professional, and user-friendly websites, leveraging cutting-edge AI tools to bring you exceptional results—faster.

### Our Approach

This is your brand. We're here to make it happen. We will protect the hard work that has gone into the existing site, bringing it back to life with a modern framework and robust infrastructure.

#### Mobile First
Everything is mobile-first. We design and rigorously test each site to ensure seamless performance across all devices—smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

#### API-Ready & Future-Proofed
While we are not currently building a web application or custom integrations, your new website will be **API-ready** and architected with future growth in mind. This means your site is structured to easily support advanced features—such as web applications or third-party integrations—should your needs evolve. You’ll have the flexibility to add new functionality when the time is right, without the need for a costly rebuild.

#### Integrated Review Widget
We will set up and integrate a Google or third-party review widget directly into your website, ensuring your positive customer feedback is front and center to build trust and drive conversions.

- **Initial setup and integration** of the review widget, tailored for optimal visibility and conversion.
- **Ongoing monitoring** during site development to ensure proper display and function.

#### Hosting on Netlify
Your new website can be hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) at **no cost** for now using Netlify’s free tier—this includes secure, high-performance global hosting with built-in HTTPS, continuous deployment, and basic features suitable for most small business sites.  
If your needs grow (such as increased traffic, advanced features, or team collaboration), Netlify offers affordable upgrades, including:
- **Starter (Free):** Up to 500 build minutes/month, 100 GB bandwidth, basic serverless functions, HTTPS & SSL.
- **Pro ($19 USD/user/mo):** Increased build minutes, more team members, password-protected sites, advanced analytics, and email support.
- **Business & Enterprise:** For higher security, compliance, and support requirements—custom pricing.

We’ll advise you if/when an upgrade makes sense, and handle the transition seamlessly.
